# surfing.py
This simple little program allows you to load your web browser with whatever website you like from the command line

This script has been tested with Ubuntu OS but can be minimally tweaked to work with whatever OS you prefer. Also, the script uses Firefox by default but can be changed to work with whatever browser you personally like. Enjoy!
